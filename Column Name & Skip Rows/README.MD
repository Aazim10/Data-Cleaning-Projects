Renaming Columns and Skipping Rows
Often, the datasets you’ll work with will have either column names that are not easy to understand, 
or unimportant information in the first few and/or last rows, such as definitions of the terms in the dataset, or footnotes.
In that case, we’d want to rename columns and skip certain rows so that we can drill down to necessary information with correct and sensible labels.
